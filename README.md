        1.  Make more space (useful for devices with limited storage).

        2.  No more spies by the bloatwares(applications installed by device manufacturers).

        3.  No more advertisements by those bloatwares.

* Launch the ADB shell.
* Extract APK with user data.
* To create an ADB backup and restore the backup.
